# StippleSolver

# main goals of this project:
1. Using Cython to create TSP art, guided by Dr.Robert Bosch. 
-- Implementing Lloyds algorithm 
-- creating an .eps file and .cyc file for Concorde TSP solver.
-- generate TSP art. 

2. Generate en masse a large dataset of TSP-art. 

3. Train a DCGAN (Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network) to create TSP art with a generative method.
